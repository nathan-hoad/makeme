Welcome to makeme! This piece of software was built on the idea that remote "administration" is too complicated for some people, especially when using mobile devices.

Using makeme, you can control your computer from anywhere in the world, as long as you have email available.

Simply send an email to the address specified in your makeme config file specifying what you want to do, and it will get done!

For a list of built in scripts, simply send an email with the subject help. Or for help with a specific script, email with the usual subject name and help in the body of the email.

This text can be customised by going to the messages folder and editing intro.
